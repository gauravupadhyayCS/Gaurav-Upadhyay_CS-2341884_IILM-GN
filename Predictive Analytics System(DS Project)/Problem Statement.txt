Logistics companies handle large volumes of shipments daily. Due to fluctuating demand and manual planning, companies often face issues such as insufficient workforce, inefficient warehouse utilization, and delayed deliveries. Traditional methods fail to predict future demand accurately. This project aims to use historical shipment data and data analytics techniques to forecast future logistics demand and assist in optimal workforce and infrastructure planning.
